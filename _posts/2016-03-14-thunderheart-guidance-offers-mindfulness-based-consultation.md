Custom Guidance

For the past ten years I have offered a service that is utterly unique here in Toronto. My specialty with clients is in offering guided meditation and custom designed mindfulness curricula, from the comfort of one's own home.

When you purchase a package of sessions with me I bring the presence that I teach. This means that I am not arriving with any assumptions or preconceptions about what you need. Instead I come with an empty mind and an open heart, allowing my encounter with you to teach me about what your meditation needs are and where in your life small moments of mindfulness could be planted.

Whether it's a couple of sessions to reset your mind and body into some clarity for the weeks to come, or a longer package designed to bring you deeper into meditation and more connected to mindfulness in your daily life, I'm ready. I know you are too.

Any questions about packages and availability can be directed to me via [email][0] or text.

Take ten minutes to rest and enjoy this ten minute guided meditation.
